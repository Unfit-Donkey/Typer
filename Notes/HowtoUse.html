        <b>Typing</b><br>
        Just click at the top of the white box(page) in the middle of the screen and start typing.<br><br>

        <b>Saving and Loading</b><br>
        To find the load and save buttons hit the "Document" button on the top of the screen.<br>
        You can save a typer file as a text file, but only open it with Typer.<br>
        Typer files contain meta data, and if you use a non-Typer program it will look funny.<br>
        Loading works just as you would upload a file into a webpage.<br>
        A load button will appear automatically when opening Typer, it will go away if you start typing.<br><br>

        <b>Naming your Document</b><br>
        On the far-left of the top bar it says "Document Name", click on it and type in the name of the document.<br>
        The name of the document will appear in the tab, so you can see what documents are where.<br><br>

        <b>Collumns</b><br>
        Hover over the "1" on the top bar, you can use the arrows to change the number of columns.<br>
        At first you can't see the collumns, just click on the right side of the document and the cursor will focus on it.<br><br>

        <b>Printing</b><br>
        Press "Print" on the top bar, there you can hit the "Print" button to print.<br>
        There is also a button for toggling a bigger font title at the top of the page.<br>
        A page count is added for your convenience.<br>
        If you type past one page the document will expand and show a dotted line where the page will cut off.<br><br>

        <b>View</b><br>
        Press the "View" button on the top bar.<br>
        A dark mode is avalaible.<br>
        Also, you can fullscreen the document.<br>
        And toggle spell check.<br><br>

        <b>Info Panel</b><br>
        Hit the "Document" button on the top bar, and then "Info".<br>
        There it will show you information about the document.<br><br>

        <b>Notes</b><br>
        Press the "N" on the far-right of the top bar.<br>
        There you can type in notes.<br>
        Notes will save and load with the document.<br><br>

        <b>Bugs</b><br>
        If you hover over "Text Here..." and hit backspace, then type, the first letter you type will be at the end of your typing.<br>
        The page separators are not completely accurate, please check what the print preview looks like before printing.<br><br><br>
